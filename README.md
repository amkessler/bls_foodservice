Each day we're seeing more cities, even entire states like Maryland, Ohio and Illinois, closing down restaurants, bars, coffee shops and similar establishments in order to prevent people from grouping together and spreading the coronavirus. Numerous such establishments are closing voluntarily around the country, or switching to take-out/delivery only.  
  
In light of that, millions of food service workers could lose their paychecks and jobs, temporarily or for good.  
  
The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.html) puts out extensive data on the workforce, including details down to the state and metro level. We'll use that to analyze for notable info to share with readers. (The most recent localized data is from 2018, that's what we'll use here.)  
  
There are top-level "major" categories of occupations that the agency captures, including the one we'll use tied to the food service industry, "Food prepration and server worker occupations."  
You can see the full details of that category [here](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes350000.htm), and it includes people like cooks, wait stuff, dishwashers, restaurant hosts, bartenders, as well as their supervisors up the chain.
